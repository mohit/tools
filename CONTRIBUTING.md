# Contributing

Thanks for contributing! This repo is a collection of small tools, so contributions should stay scoped and focused.

## Getting Started

- Pick a tool folder and read its `README.md`.
- Keep changes localized to that tool unless you are updating shared docs.
- Enable local safety hooks:
  - `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`

## Adding a New Tool

- Create a top-level folder using kebab-case (e.g., `macos-window-tidy/`).
- Add a `README.md` with install/run steps and any prerequisites.
- Add tool-specific notes if needed (e.g., `AGENTS.md`, `SECURITY.md`).

## Code Quality

- Follow the style of the existing code in the tool folder.
- Prefer small, reviewable commits with clear intent.

## Pull Requests

- Include a summary and verification steps.
- Add screenshots/GIFs for UI changes.
- Link related issues when applicable.
